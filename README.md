# CAPTCHA-Recognition-Wavelets

Use the discrete wavelet transform to break CAPTCHAs. This my own implementation of the works based on the following paper: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07468342.2005.11922116

The paper is also available in the References folder of the repository. Plese read the User_Guide.pdf for implimentation of the codes.
